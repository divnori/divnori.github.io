Hello! I'm a Senior and joint Master's student at MIT studying computer science. As a student researcher at the [Broad Institute](https://www.ericandwendyschmidtcenter.org), advised by [Prof. Wengong Jin](https://people.csail.mit.edu/wengong/) and [Prof. Caroline Uhler](https://www.carolineuhler.com), my research aims to develop machine learning methods for biological applications. With a  focus in drug discovery and biomolecular design, I am particularly interested in methods that bridge experimental, structure, and sequence data to make robust inferences.

Prior to the Broad, I was an undergraduate researcher in the [Coley Group](https://coley.mit.edu). I have also worked in industry as an ML Research Intern at [D.E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com), AI Research Intern at [Absci](https://www.absci.com), and Software Engineering Intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/biomedical-ml/).

Outside of research, I am a Teaching Assistant for the [Break Through Tech AI Program](https://computing.mit.edu/about/diversity-equity-inclusion/break-through-tech-ai/) at MIT. I'm also involved with the undergraduate biotech community through [Nucleate Dojo](https://dojo.nucleate.xyz). 

Feel free to reach out at divnor80@mit.edu!
